# Badger,<br>the first steps

Badger is a new product created by **marketgoo** to help SEO professionals like
freelancers and agencies to build and share SEO reports with their clients.

The idea comes out from market research where we discovered a lot of
professionals spend an average of 1 hour per month and per client only to create
a report containing the highlights and the progress of their SEO job done on
their websites. Reports creation is a job that they consider tedious and don't
enjoy at all. Usually in form of Google Docs containing screenshots of
third-party data sources like Google Analytics or Google Search Console.

The purpose of Badger is to automatize this work so the professionals can create
the report in seconds.

## The prototypes

After some initial interviews with SEO freelancers and agencies to confirm that
this pain is real and people are willing to pay for a solution, I've started
working on some early prototypes that then we could share with some potential
clients to validate the proposal.

You can see
[this Figma document with the first version of the proposal](https://www.figma.com/file/HmvXdY2qZRTdexxMvruEVL/Reporting-tool---By-data-sources).

In this first step, we didn't even have a name or branding style, so the
prototype was in white and black. The intention was to validate the application
flows. The feedback was pretty good, the majority of user testers say the
interface was easy and clear.

## The MVP

The prototype was promising so we decide to move to the next step: build the MVP
to be usable by real users. At that moment I was hyped about
[Tanxugueiras](https://tanxugueiras.com/) (a Galician folk trio) so I proposed
the name "Badger" for the new product (_Tanxugo_ is the Galician word for
Badger) and the green color as the primary color.

This is the logotype I've created quickly for the MVP.

We decided to reduce the scope of the first version, so some features initially
proposed like the ability to compare date ranges or apply filters were
discarded. The Figma file of this first version
[is available here](https://www.figma.com/file/SgimZgaZz0hMcK15FFA0iO/Badger-App?node-id=2406%3A14189&t=cCvLq1TaBND3CYmJ-1).

At the same time the MVP was being built, I created
[a simple landing page](https://getbadger.io) to explain how the product works
and start getting beta tester users. The design and code of the landing page
were created by me and
[the source code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/marketgoo/badger-landing).

## Badger today

The current version of Badger is available at
