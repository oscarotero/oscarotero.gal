# Hello. <br>I'm √ìscar Otero <br>‚Äîdigital designer

## ‚ÄîSuperpowers

- Listen to people.
- Divide a complex problem into several smaller and simpler ones.
- Communicate with programmers and help them to build the best possible
  interface.
- Combine fonts and colors.
- I can code my own designs.

## ‚ÄîSuccesses

- [I had my own design company](https://web.archive.org/web/20191203021950/http://v1.anavallasuiza.com/)
  with 4 partners during 8 years.
- I've been president of the [Design Association of Galicia.](http://dag.gal)
- [I won a Mestre Mateo](https://www.academiagalegadoaudiovisual.gal/es/portfolio-item/vii-premios-mestre-mateo/)
  (Galician Oscar's), and an award at the MIPTV of Cannes without making films
  but designing.
- I have [~~one~~](https://github.com/oscarotero/Embed),
  [two](https://github.com/lumeland/lume) GitHub repositories with more than
  1000 stars.
- I went to a workshop in Istanbul to teach about open video in english, and be
  able to be understood by the students.
- [I've been in a conference](https://dag.gal/gl/feed2015/) with Javier Ca√±ada,
  √Ålvaro Vali√±o, Raquel Pelta, Pepe Barro and many other great designers,
  speaking about web and interactivity.
- I've been part of a working group in the PHP-FIG, to work on a new PHP
  standard for [Http Middlewares](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-15/meta/).
- I was a member of a jury to
  [evaluate works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDnsVNcoiq8) submitted by
  spanish national design awards.

## ‚ÄîFailures

- I created a [CSS processor](http://stylecow.github.io/) but it wasn't popular.
- [I started a company](https://web.archive.org/web/20191203021950/http://v1.anavallasuiza.com/)
  with other partners but unfortunately we weren't able to do what we wanted.
- I cannot speak an excellent english (yet).
- After many attempts, I'm not able to make a homemade dough bread.
- I didn't make a beautiful personal website. But you can see some of my recent
  works [in my portfolio](/portfolio/).

### Ola

At **marketgoo** I have designed
[the **Ola** design system,](https://zeroheight.com/22mjgbuf6/p/56796c-ola) and
have collaborated in the implementation with this
[collection of React components](https://marketgoo.github.io/Ola/), for emails
with [a collection of MJML components](https://github.com/marketgoo/Ola-Emails)
and many other internal work that I cannot share currently. This project started
in 2019 and was presented
[in this post in the **marketgoo** blog](https://www.marketgoo.com/blog-post/say-hello-to-ola-design-system/).

### Lume

In late 2020, I started the [Lume project](https://lume.land/), a static site
generator built on top of Deno and inspired by other generators like Jekyll,
Hugo or Eleventy. I use it for all web projects I work since then.

- [Lume website](https://lume.land).
- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lumeland/lume).
- [Guest post in Deno official blog](https://deno.com/blog/build-a-static-site-with-lume).

### Random

- [NM type](http://www.nmtype.com/): Design and development of the web for this
  typographic studio founded by Mar√≠a Ramos (Spain) and Noel Pretorius (Sweden).
- Online cheat sheets for [jQuery](https://oscarotero.com/jquery/) and
  [Deno](https://oscarotero.com/deno/)
- [Awesome design](https://github.com/oscarotero/awesome-design): A collection
  of open source resources for web designers.
- [Chipi](https://oscarotero.github.io/chipi-client/): Design and interactive
  prototype for a desktop app to search in any service (Slack, Google Docs,
  Trello, etc).
  ([Sketch prototype](https://www.sketch.com/s/f46f510c-9f81-432b-be97-8b71d968f526),
  [chipi.io](https://chipi.io/#/))
- I collaborate in the [Tarugoconf](https://tarugoconf.com), by helping to build
  the website (made with Lume).
- Occasionally, I teach about CSS, HTML and Deno at
  [Hack a Boss](https://hackaboss.com/)

### Code

I love to write HTML/CSS and build or experiment with very under-engineering
solutions. I'm also a firmin advocate of the open source and maintainer of
several projects like:

- [Lume](https://lume.land), a static site generator for Deno.
- [A plugin for Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1001444625792698603/marketgoo-copies)
  to work with copies using Google Spreadsheets documents
  ([code](https://github.com/marketgoo/figma-copies)). Previously I had created
  [the same plugin for Sketch](https://github.com/marketgoo/sketch-copies).
- Some PHP projects: [PHP middlewares](https://github.com/middlewares) (a
  collection of PSR-15 HTTP middlewares),
  [PHP-Gettext](https://github.com/php-gettext), (a popular PHP library to work
  with Gettext), [Embed](https://github.com/oscarotero/Embed) (to get info from
  any web service or page),
  [SimpleCrud](https://github.com/oscarotero/simple-crud) (easy and magic CRUD
  in SQL databases), [FormManager](https://github.com/oscarotero/form-manager)
  (to create and validate form data).
- Several Node tools like
  [node-sketch](https://github.com/oscarotero/node-sketch) (read and edit Sketch
  documents) and
  [keep-a-changelog](https://github.com/oscarotero/keep-a-changelog) (parse and
  generate changelog files).
- Other _frontend_ libraries like
  [carousel](https://github.com/oom-components/carousel) (a _web component_ to
  create carousels) and
  [page-loader](https://github.com/oom-components/page-loader) (to load and
  create fancy transitions between pages).
